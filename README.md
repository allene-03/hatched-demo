# Hatched

Since the game is public on the platform, I prefer not to publicly share access to the source code due to privacy concerns. The repository contains limited, low-importance snippets that display some basic game functionality. If you're interested in seeing more advanced features, please feel free to reach out, and I’d be happy to share access to the full project.

Developed a pet-breeding game on Roblox using Lua over some several months. Due to the project's extensive scope, which exceeds 50,000 lines of code, the repository contains key snippets and relevant modules to showcase the core functionalities. Some referenced modules might not be included in this directory, which is why certain components may be missing.

The repository features key snippets of scripting structures, but does not include other components like models, remote events, or requests, as these exist only within the Roblox Studio environment. The scripts are designed to interact with these in-game objects, so references to non-scripting components are intentional and may not be included in this repository. This clarification is provided to address any potential confusion about the project’s content.
